# Camera Capture

A Python application to periodically capture images from a set of webcams of the `Aero Club of east Africa`: Kenya webcams (https://webcams.aeroclubea.com/index.html), saving them in a structured folder hierarchy. The configuration is managed via a simple CLI and a config file in your user profile.

---

## How the App Works

1. **Configuration**  
   The app uses a configuration file (`camera.config`) in your user profile directory to store settings such as the root folder for saving images, capture interval, and start/end times.

2. **Camera Locations**  
   Camera URLs and location names are loaded from a user provided CSV file (`camera_locations.txt`). Each row should have a `url` and a `location` column. The user is free to add/remove locations at will.

3. **Image Capture**  
   For each camera, the app downloads the latest image and saves it in a folder structure:  
   `root_folder/location/YYYY/MM/DD/`
   The root_folder is read from the configuration file when starting the app.

4. **Scheduling**  
   The app can run once, repeat for the current day, or repeat indefinitely, based on your command line options. For all locations the scheduled start and end time per day are equal.

   The capture moments are equally spaced after the `start` time and will stop
   on or before the `end` time, never after.

5. **CLI Configuration**  
   You can list and update configuration settings using the CLI.

## Command Line Options

The app provides several commands and subcommands:

### Main Commands

- **run**  
  Capture images from all cameras once.

  ```
  python -m camera run
  ```

- **run_repeat**  
  Repeat capturing images at the configured interval for the current day.

  ```
  python -m camera run_repeat
  ```

- **run_repeat_no_limit**  
  Repeat capturing images at the configured interval indefinitely.
  ```
  python -m camera run_repeat_no_limit
  ```

### Config Subcommands

- **config list**  
  List current configuration settings.

  ```
  python -m camera config list
  ```

- **config update <key> <value>**  
  Update a configuration setting.  
  Example: change the image save path
  ```
  python -m camera config update image_save_path D:/CameraImages
  ```
  Example: change the capture interval to 60 minutes
  ```
  python -m camera config update interval 60
  ```
  Example: change the start time to 07:00
  ```
  python -m camera config update start 07:00
  ```
  Example: change the end time to 19:00
  ```
  python -m camera config update end 19:00
  ```

> [!info] "GitHub"
> When the app is installed with `pip install camera_capture`, `python -m camera` can be replaced with `capture`.
>
> For example:
> `capture config list` instead of `python -m camera config list`

## Configuration File

The configuration file (`camera.config`) is stored in your user profile folder (e.g., `C:\Users\<username>\camera.config`).
When the app is first started the configuration file will be created if it does not yet exist.
It is a JSON file with keys such as:

```json
{
  "image_save_path": "D:/CameraImages",
  "start": "06:30",
  "end": "18:30",
  "interval": 30
}
```

Currently these keys are supported:

- image_save_path: The root folder for saving all the captured images.
- start: local time to start the capture (HH:MM)
- end: local time to end the capture (HH:MM)
- interval: time in minutes between captures.

You can use the CLI to update these values, or manually edit the file.

## Folder Structure

Images are saved in a hierarchy:

```
<image_save_path>/<location>/<year>/<month>/<day>/<location>_<timestamp>.jpg
```

The timestamp is in local time.

---

## Example Usage

- Capture all cameras once:

  ```
  python -m camera run
  ```

- List configuration:

  ```
  python -m camera config list
  ```

- Update interval:
  ```
  python -m camera config update interval 60
  ```

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Depends on: `requests`, `pandas`, `beautifulsoup4`

## Installing

```
pip install camera_capture
```

---

## Logging

Logs are written to `camera_capture.log` in the current directory.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Use `python -m camera config list` to check your configuration.
- Use `python -m camera config update <key> <value>` to fix any settings.
- Ensure `camera_locations.txt` exists and has `url` and `location` columns.

Example camera_locations.txt file:

```
url,location
https://webcams.aeroclubea.com/Nairobi/nbo_wilsonE.html,Wilson Airport E
```
